        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>RePg is a technology-based platform for students which helps them to find the nearby PGs around the college. It is basically for the students who have colleges in remote areas and faces a difficulty to find the suitable pg for them.  Presently we have launched in Bhopal. We will soon expand to other major cities of the country. </p>

            <h2>What we do?</h2>
            <p>We put together a list of places where student can stay as a PG.  We ensure that not only are they a safe home for the students but the students too is safe for them. These places can be searched based on locality, budget, need, and multiple other filters. Find the perfect PG stay with us.
                We contract with various food companies, van services, and laundry services to provide more good facilities to students. We done this in very low budget and by this both students and small scale businesses get profit.
                To meet our aim, we eliminate the one major problems students may face. The first of these is a lack of information for anyone in the new remote areas. Our site will list all the information.</p>
